    <h3>Interests:</h3>
   <p>Beyond coding, I have a deep love for the outdoors. 
    You can often find me outdoors, either playing sports, enjoying the beach, or hiking through scenic trails. 
    I'm a firm believer in the benefits of an active lifestyle, and I'm always up for a game of soccer, a swim in 
    the ocean, or a trek up a challenging mountain trail. Nature, for me, is the perfect escape from the digital 
    world, offering endless inspiration and serenity.</p>

    <h3>Coding Journey:</h3>
       <p>I'm still at the beginning of my coding journey, but I'm enthusiastic and eager to learn. I've already dabbled in HTML and CSS to build the foundations of web design, and I find the process of creating and styling web pages truly fascinating. Python and JavaScript, with their versatility and endless possibilities, have captured my attention, and I can't wait to unlock their full potential.</p>

       <h3>Future Goals:</h3>
           <p>As I progress in my coding skills, my goal is to combine my passion for technology with my love for the outdoors. I dream of creating web applications and tools that enhance the outdoor and sports experiences for others. Whether it's developing apps to track hiking trails, building interactive sports websites, or contributing to projects that make a positive impact, I'm excited about the possibilities that coding can offer.</p>
